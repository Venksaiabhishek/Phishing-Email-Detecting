# 🛡️ Phishing Email Detection App

Welcome to the Phishing Email Detection App! This web-based application is designed to help you identify whether an email is **phishing** or **legitimate** using a combination of powerful machine learning models, including state-of-the-art transformer-based approaches like BERT.

Built with **Streamlit**, this intuitive app allows users to input email text and receive real-time predictions, helping you stay safer online.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Venksaiabhishek/Phishing-Email-Detecting.git](https://github.com/Venksaiabhishek/Phishing-Email-Detecting.git)
    cd Phishing-Email-Detecting
    ```

2.  ** (Optional) Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/app.py
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open the app.
